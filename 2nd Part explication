In the 2nd part, there’s a lot of variation — the circuit base and components are mostly the same; what changes are small parts of the code. The main project (the one without any letters) should already be a good 
example, but if you want some specific detail about how it works, you might find it in the variations. Either way, the variations are “more of the same” — they’re not really relevant.
